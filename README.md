## How do you protect my information
None of the information has data linked to your account beyond a connection that can be made between the items, the order they are in, the purchase datetime, and your IP in the server logs. I defend against this in the following ways:
- The purchase datetime is not stored.
- The submission order is randomized before being added to the database
- If a entry is already in the database it is ommited. Meaning not all items from your account are added within the randomized order of your entries.
- All logs are cleared weekly. You're IP will only remain in a whitelist for accessing the database.
